# -Neon-Ice-Discord-Theme
A simple icey blue theme for discord :3

This theme makes the background of your discord client transparent so you can view your desktop wallpaper! It is intended to be used with the wallpaper that I have applied in the video (Arisu in Millenium by Aduare on Wallpaper Engine), however you can use whatever background you want.
If you have a background with a different colour palette than mine, you can easily change the primary color of the theme by editing the following lines of code:
--accent-hue: 175;                -[Moves along the standard colour spectrum, lowering the number will go closer to green, and hightening the number will move towards red]
--accent-saturation: 77.5%;       -[Changes the saturation of the color]
--accent-lightness: 70%;          -[Changes the harshness of the color, making this number higher will move towards white creating pastel colours, making it lower will move towards black]
